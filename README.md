# better-select-multiple

This is a simple javascript tool to create good-looking multiple-selection forms using jquery-ui autocomplete search boxes when you have to work with an underlying select multiple element, because the standard select-multiple widget completely sucks.

# usage

Include bsm.css, bsm.js, jquery-ui's bundled jquery file, jquery-ui.min.js, and jquery-ui.min.css.
After your select multiple HTML element:
```javascript
make_bsm(id) //where id is the id of the select multiple element
```
